# ImageDupFinder

ImageDupFinder is a simple C++ Qt application, which demonstrates the usage of perceptual hashing alrorithms to searching duplicate images in directories.

## Introduction
A perceptual hash is a fingerprint of an image, that can be used to compare images by calculating the Hamming distance (which basically means counting the number of different individual bits). ImageDupFinder application implementiert 3 different hashing algorithms:
- aHash
- dHash
- pHash

## aHash

## dHash

## pHash
